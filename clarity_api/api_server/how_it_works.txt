When I put the wearable on, it starts collecting data and sending it to the server.


At some point the wearable has to know to start sending data for stor

Wearable sends:
- Timestamp
- sessionId
- markerType
- Amplitude


Unity has to also send data:
- Timestamp
- SessionId
- movement_data

We need a shared sessionId.  
- User interface creates a new session
- starting the game gets a new session
- wearable finds a new session and stores the variable

We need a session table
- user id
- session_id
- status (new, in progress, complete)
- start_time
- end_time

tables
- session
- wearable data
- game data (recording)
